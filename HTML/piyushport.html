        <h2>My role</h2>
        <p>I have designed the login form page, about us page and our group member's portfolio pages by using pure HTML,
            CSS and JavaScript.<br>
            Skills I have used in designing all of these pages are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <Li>CSS (internal and external)</Li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From this project, I learnt different functionalities of form and designing the form.</p>

        <!--description of the  topic-->
        <p class="text">Technology now has been a integral part of every human being. Specially, internet social 
            media, household devices, smartphones and computer has been the closest friend of 
            human being. So we will also be taking it as the basis for analyzing the positive impact of 
            technology. The positive impact of technology can be understood with the help of the 
            following points discussed <br>
            <ul> <!--defined unordered list to show the points-->
                <li>Industrial development: 
                    The technology has been the base of industrial development. The first industrial revolution 
                    in 1760 in Great Britain happened due to the development of industrial technology where 
                    many machineries were used instead of human work force to produce various goods in the 
                    industry. Technology has also helped in research and development of new products.</li>
                    <li>Medical sector: 
                        With the development of medical technology the human life expectance itself has been 
                        improved and the average human now lives more due to available health services. Where 
                        people used to wait for death after they had caught diseases in the previous times, people 
                        now can cure even a life threatening diseases like cancer and heart attack only due to the 
                        technology.</li>
                        <li> Educational sector: 
                            Technology has been a key factor for the development of education sector. People living in 
                            one part of the world can easily know about the remains part of the world due to 
                            information technology and internet. Because of technology the research and development 
                            has been massively impacted. We knew about the importance if technology in the 
                            educational sector special at the time of COVID where even when the world was into 
                            lockdown the educational sector was somehow unimpacted due to online schooling.</li>
                        </li>
                        <li>Trade and business: 
                            Along with industrial development technology has positively impacted the trade and 
                            business sector. With the invention of e-commerce and digital marketing the trade now has 
                            been more easy and the businesses are growing massively with the proper use of 
                            technology. <br>
                            It is extremely difficult to put the positive impact of the technology into words as every 
                            sector has been impacted due to the development in the technology. Due to technology 
                            normal household work has been easier and more simpler. Internet and social media has 
                            created a state for people to express themselves. It has other positive impacts on sectors 
                            like security, communication, biotech, aviation, transportation, aerospace and so on.</li>

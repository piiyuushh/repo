        <h2>My role</h2>
        I have designed the blog page and references page in our website. I didnt have as much skills like my teammates
        so they helped me to complete my part of the work. I have used basic HTML and CSS to design the blog page.<br>
        <p>From this project I learnt the basics of HTML and CSS. I will practice it more and more to improve myself.

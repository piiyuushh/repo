        <h2>My role</h2>
        I have designed the home page of our website. Being the group leader, it was also my responsibilty to help and
        coordinate among my
        teammates. I helped them to find references from other sources. Just like my fellow teammates, I have also used
        the following skills to
        develop the home page:<br>
        <ul> <!--using unordered list to make a list of the skills used-->
            <li>HTML5</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

            as this got my intrest.</p>
